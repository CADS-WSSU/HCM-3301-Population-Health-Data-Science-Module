# HCM-3301-Population-Health-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions.

# Population Health
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Population Health as taught by Dr. Jiangmin Xu. The Population Health course is offered in Healthcare Management department once in the Spring at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for undergraduate students majoring in Healthcare Management.

This course introduces basic principles of population health relating to natural history, determinants, research, and measurements of disease, health, and selected current social conditions. The course also investigates conditions that affect global populations as opposed to individuals by defining mechanisms by which health conditions occur, are prevented, and are controlled.

# Learning Outcomes
Upon completing the course, students will have learned about population health, as well as the roles that individuals and organizations (profit and non-profit) play in the protection and promotion of positive health outcomes. Students will learn how health outcomes are assessed and examine health issues from a population health perspective. In addition, students will examine how entities such as healthcare deliviery systems, public health agencies, and community-based organizations work in tandem to develop interventions for improving health outcomes across all communities. As a data science learning outcome, students will be able to use statistical software to analyze community health or epidemiological data. Furthermore, students will be able to develop a dataset, manage surveillance databases, and perform statistical analyses. Students will learn basic skills in statistical application for population health data such as how to develop a questionnaire or form, customize the data entry process, and enter and analyze data. Also, they will learn how to assess community health outcomes and identify key sources of data for epidemiologic purposes.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. The module consists of the following:
